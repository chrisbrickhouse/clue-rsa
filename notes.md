The question asked is largely inconsequential, the main speech act is the showing or not showing of a card in response. Showing states that "I know that at least one of those items is incorrect". Meaning that subsequent changes to the guess are meaningful in determening what card was show.

Put another way, can a spectator make educated guesses based only on publicly available knowledge. How much information is contained in assertion and refutation and can knowledge shared secretly be meaningfully deduced from subsequent assertions based on that information?

A simple example:
There are ten items: five letters--A,B,C,D,E--and five numbers--1,2,3,4,5. One from each category is selected at random and removed from the set. The remaining 8 items are shuffled and distributed to four players. For the sake of this example, let's select C and 3, leaving the set as A,B,D,E,1,2,4,5. The goal of the players is to determine what items were selected.

Player 1 gets A and 1
Player 2 gets B and 2
Player 3 gets D and 4
player 4 gets E and 5

Player 1 asserts two random items that he does not have: B and 3. Having item B, player two can prove that player one's assertion is false and does so, showing her evidence to him. Now both player one and player two know that B was not selected, however players three and four know that at least one of those assertions was false. As such, their belief that B or 3 were selected is reduced (but non-zero).

Player 2 follows the strategy of player one, guessing D and 5. Having D, Player three shows it to player two and both know it cannot be D. However, independent of this, Player 4 can deduce that it is not D as well. A Player 4 knows that it cannot be 5, and Player two was shown a card by someone other than player 4, then that card must be D. Player one like three and four last ply is not able to deduce the contents of the evidence but has reduced faith in D or 5 having been selected.

Let's stop and reiterate the knowledge of each player.

What each player knows is not the selected item:
Player 1: A,1,B (diminished belief in D and 5)
Player 2: B,2,D
Player 3: D,4 (diminished belief in B and 3)
Player 4: E,5,D (diminished belief in B and 3)

Now on Player 3's turn the method of selection is more complex. The player can choose to guess two unknowns or make more tactical decisions. She could guess one complete unknown along with one known (ie, one she holds) guaranteeing that she find out whether the unknown item is selected or unselected.
